Key questions to verify:
1. Is PriceLabs called with bedrooms=3, bathrooms=3?
2. Does PriceLabs return percentile data directly, or do we compute it from comps?
3. Is the guest capacity bonus (+12%) computed correctly?
4. Does the "Average" correspond to the 50th percentile or arithmetic mean?
5. Are the 75th and 90th percentiles from PriceLabs or computed from our comp set?
