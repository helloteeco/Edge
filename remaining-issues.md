# Remaining Issues Found

## 1. Setup Services Still Shows $20/sqft
- Screenshot shows "Teeco Setup Services" with "$20/sqft" text
- The calculation might be correct ($13/sqft) but the display label is wrong
- Need to find and fix the display text

## 2. Guest Count Bonus Not Showing
- Revenue increased from $53,995 to $75,592 (40% increase)
- This suggests the multiplier IS working
- But the "+X% guest capacity bonus" indicator text is not visible
- Need to check if the indicator is rendering

## 3. Misc Expenses Field
- Shows "Misc" field with value 0 - this is working correctly

## 4. Logo
- Teeco logo is showing in header - working correctly
