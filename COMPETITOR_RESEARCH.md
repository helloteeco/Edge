## Recommendation for Edge

### To charge $1,000/year, Edge needs:

1. **Property-Specific Revenue Estimates**
   - ADR adjusted by bedrooms (1BR = base, 2BR = +20%, 3BR = +35%, 4BR = +50%)
   - Occupancy adjusted by property type
   - Clear formula users can trust

2. **Remove Confusing Elements**
   - Kill ADR adjustment slider (users don't know what to set)
   - Kill cap rate (not relevant for SFH investors)
   - Auto-calculate everything possible

3. **Show Clear Annual Revenue**
   - Big number at top: "Estimated Annual Revenue: $45,000"
   - Range: $38,000 - $52,000
   - Based on: 3BR, 65% occupancy, $189 ADR

4. **Transparent Methodology**
   - Show exactly how revenue is calculated
   - "Based on 3BR homes in [City] averaging $X ADR"
   - Build trust through transparency

5. **Unique Value (What competitors DON'T have)**
   - STR vs LTR comparison (Mashvisor has, AirDNA/Rabbu don't)
   - Focus on rural/affordable markets (competitors focus on big cities)
   - Teeco's underwriting methodology (your secret sauce)
