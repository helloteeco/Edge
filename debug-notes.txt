Search Page Bug Investigation - Feb 16, 2026

ISSUE 1: Bottom tab navigation not working on search page
- The page loads and renders content (states, cities visible)
- But the Navigation component (bottom tab bar) is not rendering in the DOM
- No nav elements found, no fixed bottom elements found
- This could be a build error causing the layout to fail on the search page
- The search page content IS rendering, so the page itself works
- The layout.tsx wraps all pages with Navigation component

ISSUE 2: "All Cities" button going to calculator
- Need to check the filter tabs - they use onClick handlers, not links
- Could be an event propagation issue or misrouted click

ISSUE 3: Account icon not consistent
- AuthHeader is imported and rendered on search page at line 471
- But it appears as a standalone green circle below the title, not inline with the title

KEY FINDING: The page renders content but the body.innerHTML was empty when checked via console
- This suggests the page may be using a different rendering path
- Or the Vercel deployment has a build issue with the search page specifically

NEXT STEP: Check the Vercel build logs for errors on the search page
Also check if removing force-dynamic from root layout caused a static build error
