DEPLOYMENT VERIFIED SUCCESSFULLY

CA state page: Now shows B (62/100) - was C (46/100). FIXED.
Explanation text: "State grade is based on the top-performing cities in the state. Adding more markets won't lower the grade — it only improves when quality cities are added."

Interactive Map (STR Grade tab):
- CA now shows green/teal (B grade) instead of yellow (C grade)
- TX shows green (A grade)
- FL shows green (A grade)
- KY/OH show dark green (A+ grade)
- Map colors are dynamically correct

Top 10 Markets: All A+ grade, legal cities (Millersburg, Berlin, Port Arthur, etc.)

Build ID changed from eyguPbMqU3F8Y4DkBY4vv to kjpY5ZOhaFKDoHnpy5mVy confirming new deployment.
