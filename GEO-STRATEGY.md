## The Problem: Edge Is Invisible to AI

I tested this live on February 17, 2026. When a user asks ChatGPT *"What are the best free tools for analyzing Airbnb short-term rental investments?"*, the response recommends **AirDNA, Mashvisor, Rentometer, Zillow, Airbnb Market Insights, and Key Data Dashboard**. Edge by Teeco is not mentioned at all — despite offering more free features than most of these tools.

This matters because AI search is no longer a future trend; it is a current reality. ChatGPT now has over 800 million weekly active users, Google Gemini has 750 million monthly users, and AI Overviews appear in roughly 16% of all Google searches [1]. In the real estate industry specifically, ChatGPT drives **95.2% of all AI referral traffic**, and that traffic converts at **4.4 times the rate** of traditional organic search [2] [3].

The question is not whether to invest in AI search visibility — it is how quickly you can start.

## What Is GEO and Why It Matters More Than You Think

**Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** is the practice of positioning your brand and content so that AI platforms — ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude — cite you when answering user queries. Unlike traditional SEO, where the goal is to rank on a search results page, GEO's goal is to become the source that AI *pulls from* when synthesizing an answer.

The distinction is critical. In traditional search, you compete for a click. In AI search, you compete for a **citation** — and a citation is effectively a recommendation. When ChatGPT tells a user "AirDNA is one of the most popular platforms for analyzing Airbnb rental data," that carries more weight than a #3 organic ranking.

| Dimension | Traditional SEO | GEO / AEO |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Goal** | Rank in search positions | Be referenced in AI-generated answers |
| **Success metric** | Clicks, impressions, CTR | Citations, mentions, share of voice |
| **Optimization levers** | Title tags, keywords, site speed | Self-contained paragraphs, clear facts, structured data |
| **Authority signals** | Backlinks, domain authority | Brand mentions across trusted platforms and communities |
| **Content format** | Long-form blog posts, landing pages | Q&A format, comparison tables, extractable paragraphs |

## The Real Estate AI Search Landscape

According to Conductor's 2026 AEO/GEO Benchmarks Report for Real Estate [2], the industry is still in the early stages of AI search adoption, but the trajectory is clear:

**AI referral traffic currently represents 1.01% of total web visits** in real estate and is growing at approximately 1% per month. While that number sounds small, the report emphasizes that AI referral traffic has significantly higher intent and conversion rates than traditional channels. This is not a volume play — it is a quality play.

**Blog content is the most cited page type** in real estate AI Overviews, appearing nearly twice as often as news pages. This is important because Edge already has 1,600+ city pages that function like data-rich blog posts. The content exists; it just needs to be structured for AI extractability.

**Zillow dominates AI Overview share of voice** at 0.06%, double its nearest competitor. This tells us that in the residential real estate space, the AI engines already have a "default" authority. Edge needs to establish itself as the authority specifically for **STR investment analysis** — a niche where Zillow has no presence.

## How Each AI Platform Selects Sources

Understanding which platforms cite which types of content is essential for prioritizing effort. Based on research from Omnius and Search Engine Land [4] [1]:

| AI Platform | Primary Sources | Content Preference | Edge's Opportunity |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Wikipedia (47.9%), Reddit (11.3%), Forbes (6.8%), G2 (6.7%) | Step-by-step explanations, third-party validation | Get mentioned on Reddit's r/ShortTermRentals, r/AirBnBHosts, r/realestateinvesting; get listed on G2 |
| **Google Gemini** | Blogs (~39%), News (~26%), YouTube (~3%) | In-depth blog posts, YouTube tutorials, peer validation | Publish comparison blog posts; create YouTube walkthroughs of Edge |
| **Perplexity** | News/media (~37%), Blogs (~28%), Gov/academic (~15%), Forums (~10%) | Data-backed, concise, bullet-point summaries | Publish original market data reports with statistics Perplexity can extract |
| **Google AI Overviews** | Blog content (most cited), comparison articles (32.5%) | Financial research, complex definitions | Structure city pages as answerable questions; create comparison content |

## Honest Assessment: What's Worth Doing vs. What's Hype

Let me be direct about what will actually move the needle for Edge versus what is marketing noise.

### High-Impact Actions (Do These First)

**1. Create an llms.txt file for edge.teeco.co**

This is the single easiest technical win. An `llms.txt` file is like `robots.txt` but specifically for AI crawlers — it tells ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other LLMs what your site is, what it offers, and which pages are most important [5]. It takes 15 minutes to create and deploy. I can build this for you right now.

**2. Post on Reddit (r/ShortTermRentals, r/AirBnBHosts, r/realestateinvesting)**

Reddit accounts for **11.3% of ChatGPT's citations** — the second-highest source after Wikipedia [4]. This is not about spamming links. It is about genuinely participating in discussions, sharing Edge's free market data when someone asks "what's the best market for Airbnb under $250K?", and letting the community discover the tool organically. One well-received Reddit post can influence AI citations for months.

**3. Publish original data reports on edge.teeco.co/blog**

Edge has something AirDNA, Mashvisor, and Rabbu do not offer for free: **investment grades and scores for 1,611 markets powered by PriceLabs data**. Publishing quarterly reports like "Top 25 Airbnb Markets Under $300K in Q1 2026" or "Which States Have the Best STR Regulations?" creates citable, data-rich content that AI platforms love. Research shows that content with original statistics receives a **30–40% visibility lift** in AI citations [6].

**4. Structure existing city pages for AI extractability**

The 1,600+ city pages already contain the data. The problem is that AI engines need self-contained, extractable paragraphs — not just data tables. Adding a 2–3 sentence summary paragraph at the top of each city page (e.g., *"Gatlinburg, Tennessee is rated A+ for Airbnb investment with an average annual revenue of $48,000, 72% occupancy rate, and a median home value of $385,000. The market is legal for short-term rentals and scores 88/100 on Edge's investment index."*) makes each page a potential AI citation source.

### Medium-Impact Actions (Do These Within 90 Days)

**5. Get listed on comparison/review sites**

Since 32.5% of AI citations come from comparison articles [4], getting Edge included in "Best Airbnb Analysis Tools" roundups on sites like BiggerPockets, Investopedia, NerdWallet, or Forbes Advisor would directly increase citation probability. Reach out to authors of existing comparison articles and offer Edge as a free alternative to AirDNA.

**6. Create YouTube content**

YouTube accounts for ~3% of Gemini's citations — the highest single-domain citation rate [4]. A simple screen recording walkthrough of "How to Find the Best Airbnb Market Using Edge (Free)" would serve double duty: YouTube SEO and Gemini citation fuel. You do not need production quality; authenticity matters more.

**7. Add FAQ schema to every page (already done)**

We already implemented FAQ schema on city, state, and calculator pages as part of the SEO work. This directly supports AI Overviews, which trigger on 4.5% of real estate queries and heavily favor FAQ-structured content [2].

### Lower-Impact Actions (Nice to Have, Not Urgent)

**8. Wikipedia mention**

Wikipedia accounts for 47.9% of ChatGPT citations [4], but getting a Wikipedia page or mention requires notability criteria that Edge may not yet meet. This becomes viable once Edge has press coverage, user base metrics, or academic citations. Do not pursue this now.

**9. Paid AI visibility tools**

Tools like Profound, Otterly, and Peec AI track your brand's AI citation share of voice. They cost $400–600+/month and are mostly useful for enterprise brands. At Edge's current stage, manual testing (asking ChatGPT and Perplexity about STR tools monthly) is sufficient and free.

## The llms.txt File: What I Can Build Right Now

The `llms.txt` file is a plain text file hosted at `edge.teeco.co/llms.txt` that tells AI crawlers [5]:

- What Edge is (STR investment analysis platform)
- What it offers for free (AI agent, 1,611+ market data, funding quiz, interactive map)
- Which pages are most important (city pages, calculator, search)
- How the data is structured

This is a 15-minute implementation that I can push to GitHub immediately. It will not affect any existing features.

## What NOT to Waste Money On

To be honest about what is not worth your time or budget right now:

**Paid GEO agencies** charging $5,000–15,000/month are targeting enterprise brands with $1M+ marketing budgets. Edge's competitive advantage is that the product itself is the marketing — 1,600+ free city pages, a free AI agent, and free market data. The content exists; it just needs distribution.

**AI visibility tracking tools** at $400–600/month are overkill. Test manually once a month by asking ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini about STR investment tools and see if Edge appears.

**Press releases** about Edge launching are unlikely to generate meaningful AI citations. AI platforms favor ongoing, substantive content over one-time announcements.

---

## The Bottom Line

Edge has a genuine competitive advantage that no amount of GEO optimization can manufacture: **it is actually free for the most valuable features**. AirDNA charges $99–499/month. Mashvisor charges $49–249/month. Edge offers free AI-powered market analysis, free data for 1,611 markets, a free funding quiz, and a free interactive map.

The problem is not the product — it is that AI platforms do not know Edge exists yet. The llms.txt file, Reddit presence, and original data reports are the fastest path to changing that. Within 90 days, Edge should start appearing in AI-generated recommendations for STR investment tools.

The SEO work we already completed (dynamic meta tags, FAQ schema, internal linking, /airbnb-calculator landing page) provides the foundation. GEO builds on top of it. They are complementary, not competing strategies.
