## Interactive Comp Map Replacement (February 2026)
- [x] Replace static Google Maps embed with interactive Leaflet map
- [x] Show target property pin (distinct marker) on the map
- [x] Show all comparable listing pins with popups (photo, ADR, revenue, bedrooms)
- [x] Comp pins should be clickable with rich info popups (like Rabbu's calculator)
- [x] Map should be scrollable/zoomable on mobile (touchscreen friendly)
- [x] Auto-fit map bounds to show target + all comps
- [x] Ensure no regressions to existing calculator features
